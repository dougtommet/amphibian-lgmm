## Read in the monte carlo data

If we have actual data to use, we could jump directly to this step and read in the data in the usual way.

MplusAutomation has a nice command to read in data created by Mplus.  Otherwise you would need to do a command similar to the one commented out.

The growth mixture model in Mplus likes data in a "wide" format, where each measurement time is a new variable. The package ggplot likes data in a "long" format, where the measurements are stacked in one variable and another variable indicates when the measurement was taken.  

This code takes the "wide" data file and converts it to "long".

```{r}
data <- getSavedata_Data("monte-carlo.out") 
colnames(data) <- tolower(names(data))  

# data <- read.fwf(file="mcdata.dat", header=FALSE, 
#                  widths = c(rep(13, 6), 3), 
#                  col.names = c("y1", "y2", "y3", "y4", "y5", "y6", "c"))

data <- data %>%
  mutate(id = row_number(),
         subsample = runif(nrow(.)))

data.long <- data %>% 
  gather(foo, y, y1:y6) %>%
  mutate(time = as.numeric(str_sub(foo, 2))) %>%
  arrange(id, time) %>%
  select(-foo)

head(data)
head(data.long, 18)

```
