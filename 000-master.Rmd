## Overview

After fitting a growth mixture model, we are often interested in the shape of the trajectories for the latent classes.  This presentation shows how to create a figure that has the estimated tractery for each latent class.  A similar figure is seen in *van de Schoot (2016)* (Figure 3).  The figure is created in R using ggplot2.

## Overview
This presentation will cover:

* Creating the data using Mplus monte carlo
* Reading the data into R
* Doing a quick exploratory analysis
* Fitting a growth mixture model in Mplus
* Using the results from the Mplus analysis to create a plot of trajectories by class.
