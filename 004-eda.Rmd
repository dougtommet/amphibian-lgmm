## Exploratory data analysis

This is just a simple plot to visualize the data.  In a real analysis, you should do more.
```{r}

data.long %>%
  filter(subsample <.2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=time, y=y, group=id)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), size=2)
```

This is the plot we'd ideally like to have.  However, with real data the true latent class variable is unknown.
```{r}
# The variable c is the "true" latent class membership
data.long %>%
  filter(subsample <.25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=time, y=y, group=id)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(. ~c)

```
